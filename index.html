    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is Chloe Flamm and I am a second-year Data Science major and Mathematics minor at Northeastern University.
      I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, and attended Mission San Jose High School. 
      There I participated in various volunteering projects such as Relay for Life through the American Cancer Society as well as playing on the varsity softball team for three years. 
      I spent my first-year at Northeastern University London through the London Scholars Program studying as well as traveling across Europe, exploring various new cities. 
      On Boston campus, I participate in the Artificial Intelligence club, both going to weekly Forum discussions and refining my skills in their AI Bootcamp course. 
      This summer, I am thrilled to be joining the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy for my first Co-op experiential learning opportunity from July through the Fall Semester. 
      As a Data Science Intern, I hope to gain real-world experience, as well as contribute to such an impactful cause. In my free time I enjoy going on long distance runs when it’s sunny out. 
      On rainy days, I enjoy working on crocheting projects, whether it’s knitting a scarf or a full blanket. 
      Overall, I make time for being outside with friends and family, going on hikes, traveling, trying new cafés and restaurants, as well as cooking at home. </p>
